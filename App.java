Create an app (using instan class and only the Scanner class for input) that takes in a String from a user and does the following:

Assume the String can only take letters spaces and full stops

         Counts the letters

         Counts vowels

         Stores a new String that only contains every second letter

         Stores the positions of each space

         Outputs a new String with all vowels are replaced/printed as exclamation points

Please note: Create only 1 app class, but either create multiple instantiable classes, or multiple computes to deal with each bullet point

			sentence=scanner.nextLine();

		//set //send what user input to the instantiable class file
		object.setSentence(sentence); //same setName than in instantiable class file

		//compute
		object.compute();//same computeName than in instantiable class file

		//get //get info from instantiable class file and store it, into variables of the App file
		letter=object.getLetter(); //same getName than in instantiable class file
		count=object.getCount();

		str=object.getStr();

		intMsg=object.getIntMsg();

		stringMsg=object.getStringMsg();

		//output
		System.out.println("Number of letters in the given sentence is "+letter);
		System.out.println("Number of vowels in the given sentence is "+count);

		//output done in the instantiables class file
		//System.out.print("Space at the position "+intMsg);

		//output done in the instantiables class file
		//System.out.print(str);

		//output the new String msg that replace vowel by !
		System.out.println("All vowels are replaced/printed as exclamation points = "+stringMsg);
