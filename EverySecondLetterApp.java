Create an app (using instan class and only the Scanner class for input) that takes in a String from a user and does the following:

Assume the String can only take letters spaces and full stops

         Counts the letters

         Counts vowels

         Stores a new String that only contains every second letter

         Stores the positions of each space

         Outputs a new String with all vowels are replaced/printed as exclamation points

Please note: Create only 1 app class, but either create multiple instantiable classes, or multiple computes to deal with each bullet point

//method
import java.util.Scanner; //utility package - allowing for user input
public class EverySecondLetterApp{
	public static void main(String[] args){

		//variable
		String sentence; //old String
		char msg;
		String str; //new String

		//Scanner + Object
		Scanner scanner=new Scanner (System.in);
		EverySecondLetter object=new EverySecondLetter();

		//input //ask to input //user answer are store into sentence (variable)
		System.out.println("Enter a sentence :");
			sentence=scanner.nextLine();

		//set //send what user input to the instantiable class file
		object.setSentence(sentence); //same setName than in instantiable class file

		//compute
		object.compute();//same computeName than in instantiable class file

		//get //get info from instantiable class file
		str=object.getStr(); //same getName than in instantiable class file

		//output done in the instantiables class file
		//System.out.print(str);
	}
